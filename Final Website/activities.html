        Hiking, fishing, snowboarding, skiing, anything outdoors you can possibly think of you can do in Bellingham.

        There are multiple local small owned shops to check out from glass art to exotic fish.

        If food is what you are looking for then there is plenty of options from Ramen to ABCrepes.

        Those over twenty one can enjoy Kulshan Brewery, a local brewery that makes beers in Bellingham.

        You can end the night with ice cream from Mallard's which is all done locally.
