        Bellingham (/ˈbɛlɪŋhæm/ BEL-ing-ham) is the most populous city in, and county seat of Whatcom County in the U.S. state of Washington. 
        It lies 21 miles (34 km) south of the U.S.–Canada border in between two major cities of the Pacific Northwest: Vancouver, British Columbia (located 52 miles (84 km) to the northwest) and Seattle (90 miles (140 km) to the south). 
        The city had a population of 92,314 as of 2019.

        The city of Bellingham, incorporated in 1903, consolidated four settlements: Bellingham, Whatcom, Fairhaven, and Sehome. 
        It takes its name from Bellingham Bay, named by George Vancouver in 1792, for Sir William Bellingham, the Controller of Storekeeper Accounts of the Royal Navy during the Vancouver Expedition.
        
        Today, Bellingham is the northernmost city with a population of more than 50,000 people in the contiguous United States.
         It is a popular tourist destination known for its easy access to outdoor recreation in the San Juan Islands and North Cascades.
          More than 100 acres (40 ha) of former industrial land on the Bellingham waterfront is undergoing redevelopment, with plans for a hotel, conference center, condos, retirement housing, retail and commercial development.
